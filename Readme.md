# JWT example app
Inside each of the app/server or www, install modules and type `yarn start` to start it up. Do note that www and app run on the same port so, don't run both at the same time.

## Server
- express

## App
- next + react, testing SSR

## WWW
- next + react just to call api, nothing special
